							The successful migration of most legacy systems for a number of Hospitals including: UCLH, Queen Mary's and Chelsea & Westminster onto a common platform which would act as the basis for london wide patient appoinment management and the access to a patient's medical history by a number of authorised personnel.  Acting as the lead interface analyst between the company's product (Centricity Enterprise) and national NHS databases (PDS, C&B).  We developed the clinical messaging (HL7) and commissioning (PCT reporting) upgrade together with the messaging infrastructure to support this.  This was on a combination of HP Non-Stop and Unix platforms.

							Development of clinical modules with EDI interfaces between central and third party external systems.  the development consisted of a database/backend system written in a mixture of C++, COBOL, and Enform.  The corresponding user front-end subsystems which was written on C (on windows).

							System integration between the Trust's core system and ancilliary systems including pathology and analysis equipment.
