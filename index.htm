                <h6 class="docs-header">The Crunchy Corner</h6>
                <p> The Crunchy Corner was set up ten years ago as I wanted to apply the knowledge I had gained so far in a wider range of industries while being exposed to different business processes and technologies. With that experience I feel confident that working together with your organisation we can make the most of your information, teams and systems. </p>
                <p> I have worked with major organisations in the financial, health care and security sectors, these include: Motability Operations, Sporting Index, Finkit (formerly Monitise) and BT Global Services. A full list of clients and case studies can be found <a herf="aboutClients.htm" title="The Crunchy Coner's Clients">here</a>. </p>
                <h6 class="docs-header">Software Development</h6>
                <p> Tailored solutions give clients the reliability, quality and support that is vital in today's business environment. </p>
                <p> Systems are usually based on a mixture of languages running on a wide variety of platforms, this means any additions to your team are unlikely to have a background that perfectly matches your unique combination of frameworks, chosen OS, databases, testing tools firewalls and other ancialliary services. A sensible approach is to find someone who has a solid knowledge on the majority of technologies you use and the flexibility to pick up any additional ones quickly. </p>
                <p> So whether you rely on Java, javascript, sql server, oracle db, nosql, node, unix or windows I feel confident I can meet your organisation's requirements.
                </p>
                <h6 class="docs-header">Integration Services</h6>
                <p> Organisations sometimes have a myriad of systems acting as stand alone silos which hold information vital to more than just one part of the business, allternatively they may rely on third-party data sources or external equipment which provide data in real-time basis, this then needs to be fed into the rest of the infrastructure</p>
                <p> Integration allows your organisation to treat these disparate data sources -either by data migration or through automated data exchange- as a single, cohesive data source. This then allows you to increase the speed of individual transactions, gives you access to more timely reporting, and more importantly, vastly reduces data quality issues by automating system interactions. </p>
                <p> In some cases it will be necessary to review and modify the existing codebase to meet new  integration needs. With many years in software development you can rest assured any changes made as part of your project will be seamless. </p>
                <h6 class="docs-header">System Analysis, Deployment and Support</h6>
                <p> Upgrades, moves to alternative technologies and the introduction of new components or infrastructure can affect existing systems. Using the experience I have accumulated through different projects in a number of industries I can help analyse the impact such a move will have on your current processes. This will help to identify what changes are needed in order to support the move or identify alternative approaches to acheieve the desired result. </p>
